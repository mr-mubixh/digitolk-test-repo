* I think the unnecessary variables used in the code, so I removed them 
* code should be clean, try to use less if else, the code will be more readable
* the spaces should be less
* same variable in whole class can be initialized in the constructor function
* we can use the same function in controller for same functionality, like if there are multiple actions to
    same module, like canceljob, deletejob, addjob, we can use the same function in controller 
with different params, the params will decide which function should be call for this action
* variables names should follow any naming convention, I preferred snake case
* on update function in BookingController, //not best approach to update data, 
  the un-fillable fields should be excluded in the model class
